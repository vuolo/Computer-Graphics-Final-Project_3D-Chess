<h2>About The Project</h2>

In this 3D Chess game project, we've revamped the traditional chess experience using OpenGL in pygame, offering players an immersive experience with enhanced graphics, customizable boards, and game pieces. The game stands out with its realistic physics, including fluid movement animations, soft shadows, and reflections, and is further enriched by integrating the Stockfish chess engine for a challenging AI-driven gameplay.

<h2>Implemented Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Customizable Game Pieces: Choose from various materials like wood or metal, each with distinct reflections and textures.</li>
  <li>Customizable Chess Board: Options include classic, wooden, and RGB.</li>
  <li>Customizable Environments: From space environments to imaginary lands.</li>
  <li>Game Physics: Movement animations for chess pieces with soft shadows and realistic reflections.</li>
  <li>AI Integration: Challenging gameplay with the Stockfish chess engine.</li>
  <li>Sounds: Including distinct effects for piece movements, special audio cues for capturing pieces, checks, and checkmates, as well as ambient background music that varies by selection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To start the game: `python -m main`
